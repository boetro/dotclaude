# Iterate Command

## Steps:

1. **Write the code** - Implement the requested changes
2. **Test** - Test the newly written code and analyze results
3. **Report** - Provide a clear summary of what was changed and test outcomes

Continue iterating (fix → deploy → test) until all tests pass, then report final results.
