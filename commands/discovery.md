# Project Planning & Discovery

Lead the user through thorough project discovery before any implementation. Ask questions ONE section at a time and wait for their response before proceeding.

## Discovery Process

**1. Business Requirements**
- What problem does this solve and for whom?
- What are your success metrics?
- Timeline and resource constraints?

**2. Technical Scale & Performance**
- Expected users, traffic, data volume?
- Performance requirements?
- Must integrate with existing systems?

**3. Security & Compliance**
- What sensitive data will you handle?
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
- Authentication/authorization approach?

**4. Technology Stack**
- Language/framework preferences?
- Hosting preferences (AWS, Azure, self-hosted)?
- Database requirements?

**5. Development & Operations**
- Team size and experience level?
- CI/CD and testing strategy?
- Monitoring requirements?

## After Gathering Requirements

Provide:
1. **Recommended Tech Stack** - justified choices
2. **Architecture Diagram** - mermaid format
3. **Security Checklist** - specific to their needs
4. **Project Structure** - initial file/folder layout
5. **Implementation Roadmap** - phased milestones
6. **Risk Assessment** - potential issues and solutions
7. **Export finalized design / report** - finalized design / report should be written and date to /Users/calebvandyke/code/designs/<project-name>/design.md. The file should include a frontmatter section at the top with the following fields: created_at, last_updated_at, status (status should be set to DRAFT) 

Challenge assumptions. Suggest best practices. Prioritize security from day one.
