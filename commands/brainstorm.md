# Brainstorm - Problem Analysis & Solution Design

Thoroughly analyze the current problem before proposing any solutions. Focus on identifying root causes and asking clarifying questions.

## Phase 1: Critical Analysis

Before proposing solutions, systematically examine:

1. **Root Cause Identification**
   - What is the actual problem vs. symptoms?
   - Is this a bug, architecture issue, performance problem, or implementation challenge?
   - What are the contributing factors?

2. **Codebase Context**
   - Review relevant code sections
   - Identify existing patterns and conventions
   - Note any related issues or dependencies

3. **Clarifying Questions**
   Ask the user about:
   - Requirements: What must the solution accomplish?
   - Constraints: Technical limitations, deadlines, resources?
   - Priorities: Performance vs. maintainability vs. speed of implementation?
   - Scope: Does this need to solve related problems too?

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user's answers before proceeding to solutions.

## Phase 2: Solution (After User Responds)

After receiving clarification, provide:

1. **Recommended Solution**
   - Specific, actionable approach
   - Clear implementation steps
   - Code examples if relevant

2. **Reasoning**
   - Why this solution is optimal
   - How it addresses root causes
   - Tradeoffs considered

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Briefly mention other viable options
   - Explain why the recommended solution is better

## Output Style

- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on root causes, not just symptoms
- Always ask questions before jumping to solutions
